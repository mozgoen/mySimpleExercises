We want to create a function, which returns an array of functions,
which return their index in the array. For better understanding, here an example:

var callbacks = createFunctions(5); // create an array, containing 5 functions

callbacks[0](); // must return 0
callbacks[3](); // must return 3

We already implemented that function, but when we actually run the code,
the result doesn't look like what we expected. Can you spot, what's wrong with it?
A test fixture is also available

<script>
    function createFunctions(n) {
        let arrOfFunctions = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arrOfFunctions.push(function () {
                return i;
            });
        }
        return arrOfFunctions;
    }



</script>
