Your job at E-Corp is both boring and difficult. It isn't made any easier by the fact that everyone constantly wants to have a meeting with you, and that the meeting rooms are always taken!

In this kata, you will be given an array. Each value represents a meeting room. Your job? Find the first empty one and return its index (N.B. There may be more than one empty room in some test cases).

'X' --> busy 'O' --> empty

If all rooms are busy, return 'None available!'.

<script>

  function meeting(x){
    function isEmpty(elem) {
      if (elem !== 'O') {
        return false;
      }
      return true;
    }

    const index = x.findIndex(isEmpty);

    if (index === -1) {
      return 'None available!'
    } else {
      return index;
    }
  }


</script>
