Preloaded for you in this Kata is a class Animal:
class Animal {
constructor(name, age, legs, species, status) {
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
this.legs = legs;
this.species = species;
this.status = status;
}
introduce() {
return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
}
}
Task
Define the following classes that inherit from Animal.
I. Shark
The constructor function for Shark should accept 3 arguments in
total in the following order: name, age, status.
All sharks should have a leg count of 0 (since they obviously do not have any legs)
and should have a species of "shark".

II. Cat
The constructor function for Cat should accept the same 3 arguments as
with Shark: name, age, status. Cats should always have a leg count of 4 and a species of "cat".

Furthermore, the introduce/Introduce method for Cat should be identical
to the original except there should be exactly 2 spaces and the words "Meow meow!"
after the phrase. For example:

var example = new Cat("Example", 10, "Happy");
example.introduce() === "Hello, my name is Example and I am 10 years old.
Meow meow!"; // Notice the TWO spaces - very important
III. Dog
The Dog constructor should accept 4 arguments in the specified order: name,
age, status, master. master is the name of the dog's master which will be a string.
Furthermore, dogs should have 4 legs and a species of "dog".

Dogs have an identical introduce/Introduce method as any other animal, but
they have their own method called greetMaster/GreetMaster which accepts no arguments and
returns "Hello (insert_master_name_here)" (of course not the literal string but replace
the (insert_master_name_here) with the name of the dog's master).



Task 2
Define the following classes.

I. Cuboid
The object constructor for the class Cuboid should receive exactly three arguments in the following order: length, width, height and store these three values in this.length, this.width and this.height respectively.

The class Cuboid should then have a getter surfaceArea which returns the surface area of the cuboid and a getter volume which returns the volume of the cuboid.

II. Cube
class Cube is a subclass of class Cuboid. The constructor function of Cube should receive one argument only, its length, and use that value passed in to set this.length, this.width and this.height.

Hint: Make a call to
super
, passing in the correct arguments, to make life easier ;)
