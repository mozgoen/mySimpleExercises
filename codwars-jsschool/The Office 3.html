The bloody photocopier is broken... Just as you were sneaking around the office to print off your favourite binary code!

Instead of copying the original, it reverses it: '1' becomes '0' and vice versa.

Given a string of binary, return the version the photocopier gives you as a string.

<script>

  function broken(x){
    let newStrArr = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
      (x[i] === '0') ? newStrArr.push('1') : newStrArr.push('0');
    }
    return newStrArr.join('');
  }


</script>
